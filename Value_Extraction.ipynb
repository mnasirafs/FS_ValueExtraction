    "As of the last update in April 2023, I don't have access to real-time databases or the ability to fetch live data, so I can't provide the most current specific ratio of raw material costs to the selling price in the food industry in Saudi Arabia. However, I can offer some general insights that might help you understand the dynamics of this ratio within the food or restaurant industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the food industry, the cost of raw materials relative to the selling price, often referred to as the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), is a critical measure that significantly impacts profitability. This ratio can vary widely depending on several factors, including the type of cuisine, sourcing practices, and market positioning of the establishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Guidelines:\n",
    "Fast Food and Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs): These establishments typically have a higher COGS ratio, ranging from 88% to 35% of the selling price, due to the emphasis on convenience and speed, which often requires pre-processed or ready-to-cook ingredients that can be more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Casual Dining: For casual dining restaurants, the COGS ratio often ranges between 25% and 30% of the selling price. These restaurants balance between the quality of ingredients and cost-efficiency, aiming to offer a more affordable dining experience compared to fine dining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine Dining: Fine dining restaurants, which focus on the quality of ingredients, unique menus, and a higher level of service, can have a COGS ratio that is lower, around 20% to 30% of the selling price, due to higher menu prices. However, the absolute cost of raw materials in fine dining can be significantly higher because of the premium ingredients used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifics for Saudi Arabia:\n",
    "Local vs. Imported: The ratio can also be affected by the origin of the raw materials. Imported ingredients might increase the COGS due to shipping and import taxes, a factor that can be significant in Saudi Arabia, where many food items are imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Trends: The food industry in Saudi Arabia is influenced by local dietary preferences, international cuisine's popularity, and governmental policies on food importation and sustainability. These factors can lead to fluctuations in raw material costs.\"\"\"\n",
